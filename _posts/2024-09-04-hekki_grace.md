There's a tabletop roleplaying game about languages called Dialect, where the players explore a language shared by an isolated community. The neat thing is that, because of the way language works, the words that the players create are _actual words with semantic meaning known only to the esoteric community playing together_. 

Games (digital and tabletop) are particularly good at inducting you into a language. By the end of the game, you have new vocabulary, new associations of ideas. In a small way, at the end of a good game you're a new person.

[1000xResist](https://www.sunsetvisitor.studio/) is going to stick with me for a long time. There's nothing there that I haven't seen before (in terms of mechanics) and there's everything there that I've never seen before (in terms of how those mechanics are deployed). This is a very confident design, using every detail in service of the narrative expereince, reconfiguring to fit the needs of the story.

Often, when I've seen a narrative game combined with other mechanics, the most common failure mode is to have the mechanic end up as a one-off event. I'm impressed with the degree to which that isn't the case here. The mechanics constantly reused in new narrative contexts.

Despite reusing the same mechanics, the game doesn't let you rest in one pardigm.
